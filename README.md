# smart-photo-cleaner
My first public study on Python to recognize my family in my smartphone's photos.
After that all these photo will be stored in a folder (PC) so that i can organize an efficient cleanup

What should I use in this project?
First of all I'll use Yolo and PyTorch transfer learning, because the task is to understand how to use a pre-trained model to find some particular object/person
During this project I'll also learn new way to use GUI like web-based interface
